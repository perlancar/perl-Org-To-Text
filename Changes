Revision history for Org-To-Text

0.001    2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.

         - Rename CLI script from export-org-to-text -> org-to-text.


0.00    2011-09-07 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release. Not yet implemented.
